# Deploying a HuggingFace BERT Model with Seldon Core V2

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how we can deploy custom NLP models on Seldon Core v2. The custom model I have is the uniqueness model defines a score between 0 to 1 which measures the level of uniqueness in the tweets. This model computes a single uniqueness score by taking a list of tweets as input.

We covered the steps below in this project.
- What is Seldon Core?
- Inference Servers in Core v2
- Deploying custom NLP models in Seldon Core V2
- Deploying custom NLP models to Kubernetes
